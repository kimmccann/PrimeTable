# PrimeTable

#How to run
In order to run the program you can build the program in Visual Studio by selecting Build Solution from the Build menu, then running this solution.
Alternatively, I have added PrimeTable.exe to the root on github in order to allow easy running.
Once it runs it simply waits for user input of the number of primes.

#What you're pleased with
I am pleased with my solution to this problem and that it works efficiently.
I am happy that I realised to discount all even numbers to reduce the number of items that needed to be checked to be prime.

#What you'd do if you have more time
If I had more time then I would perhaps implement a more efficient algorithm such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
With more time I would be able to learn about how this algorithm works rather than just implementing a niave approach.
